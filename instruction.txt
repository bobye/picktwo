Visit the following link to access the study. You are invited to 
work on 500 out of 3000 in total tasks. The tasks are to identify 
two out of three paintings that belong to the same artist. 
In order to find the artist, you are free to use any source of 
visual properties about images at the presented resolution, such 
as contents, styles, brushstrokes, color themes, etc. Some tasks 
are difficult than others, so don't worry if you can not identify 
all the correct answers.
